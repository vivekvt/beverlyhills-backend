Arthritis is a broad term for ailments that affect joints and the tissues that surround them. Most types of arthritis either fall into one of two categories: degenerative arthritis (like osteoarthritis) or inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis). These typically occur in areas such as the hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists. Although we have heard that arthritis is just something that we have to deal with as we age, there is good news. Many types of arthritis can be treated by regenerative medicine, allowing for better functionality of the joint and reduced pain symptoms.",

Chiropractic care treats physical conditions to support health, wellness and pain-free living in a natural way.  Our approach combines chiropractic care with regenerative treatments using stem cells and platelet rich plasma injections. Often patients have a medical condition which benefit, in part, from each.  But, by putting these methods together, we create a synergy that can improve results versus using only one type of method.",
